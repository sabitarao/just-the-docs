# What is `FLINT`?

The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is a C++ framework that combines satellite and ground data in ways that meet policy needs. It is based on over 20 years of experience building and operating integration tools in Australia and Canada.   It's an Open-source Library maintained under [**moja.global**](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/README.md), a project under the Linux Foundation

## Why FLINT?

The FLINT makes developing and operating advanced systems achievable by all countries. It is a generic platform with a modular structure, allowing countries to attach any variety of models or data to build country-specific systems. The platform handles complex computer science tasks, such as the storage and processing of large data sets, leaving users to focus on monitoring, reporting and scenario analyses.  

## How is FLINT different from earlier integrating tools?

The FLINT is using the lessons learned from first generation tools, to build a new framework that meets present and future needs. The key improvements compared to the first generation tools include:
+ a flexible, modular approach, allowing for country specific implementations from [IPCC Tier 1 to 3 ](https://www.reddcompass.org/mgd-content-v1/dita-webhelp/en/Box1.html)
+ support for [wall-to-wall, sample based, jurisdictional, and supply chain approaches](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5896200f414fb57d26f3d600/t/59362b028419c2db8f57e747/1496722191543/REDD_nested_projects.pdf)
+ the ability to cover all [land uses and land use changes, and activity-based reporting such as REDD+](https://theredddesk.org/what-redd)
+ scenario analysis systems to allow the development of projections
+ the potential to be used for multiple other purposes, including economics, water and biodiversity
+ development managed using a true open source approach under [moja global](http://moja.global), which will allow users (countries, companies and organizations) to direct strategy and control the budget.
+ software that allows data processing on local desktops or cloud-based systems
