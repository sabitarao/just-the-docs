## User Interface Contributions   

We really need your help!  

One of the most important improvements for our flagship software FLINT is the user interface. Please help us to improve.  

The process to follow is the same as for [contributing code](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Contribute-Code.md) but you will have to [start a new project](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) and [repository](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-To-Create-a-Repository.md).
