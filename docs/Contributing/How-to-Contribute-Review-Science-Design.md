Science Designs are developed collaboratively and everybody is invited to contribute.  

It is advisable to review the science design before contributing to the code or the documentation.  

Follow the following steps to contribute to or review a science design:

    * The Science folder will contain 2 types of Science Designs:
        * PDF files contain completed science designs.  
        * .md files contain a link to science designs under development. 
    * Locate the PDF file with the highest [version number](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Assign-a-Version.md) for review
