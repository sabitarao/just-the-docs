## Create a Repository:  
  
1. If you are a member of the moja global organization, define a new repository  
    * Use a short version of your title as repository name (i.e. moja-global/repository-name)
    * Use the full title as the description of the repository
    * Make the repository public
    * Initialize with a Read-Me document which includes the abstract of your project
    * Create your repository  

1. If you are not a member of the moja global organization, the moja global team will create the repository for you and invite you as an outside member to take charge of the project. Follow these steps:
    * Navigate to .github repository
    * Click Issues
    * Click the green button "Get Started" in the Feature Request box.
    * Use the title of your project as the title of the requested features
    * In the body of the Issue, provide the abstract of your project first. Then follow the template to the extent it is useful and provide as much information as possible
    * Attach files, screenshots and animated GIFs
    * Click the green button "Submit New Issue" at the bottom right corner  
    * If you have not received a reply within 2 days, please write to info@moja.global
