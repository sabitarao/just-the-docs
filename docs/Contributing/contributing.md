Here are some guidelines and instructions for contributing to our projects. Please go through them before making a contribution.

Please report unacceptable behavior to info@moja.global. If you want your report to be handled confidentially, please report to guy@moja.global.

Before asking any questions, please have a look at our [FAQs](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/wiki). If your question isn't answered there, please write to info@moja.global.

If your question concerns the code of a project, then you should create a [new issue] in the relevant project's repository.

## How To Get Credit for Your Contribution?

We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize contributors.

To get recognized, just add the following line to a comment after making your contribution (like submitting a pull request, replying to a question, resolving an issue, etc.):

```
@all-contributors please add <@username> for <contributions>
```

Replace `<@username>` with your GitHub username and `<contributions>` with any word from [this list](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

After that, the @all-contributors bot will submit a PR to include you in the list of contributors. Once this PR gets accepted, you'll get added to the Contributors table in the relevant project's `README`.


## How to Contribute Code?

Bug fixes, performance improvements, code formatting, ...
There are a lot ways in which you can contribute code!
The issues list of a project is a great place to find something that you can help us with.

To increase the chances of your code getting merged, please ensure that:
* You satisfy our [contribution criteria](Governance/Contribution-Criteria.md).
* Your code follows our [coding guidelines](Governance/Coding-Guidelines.md).
* Your submission follows [Vincent Driessen's Git Branching](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) System.
* Your code's documentation follows our [rules](Contributing/How-to-Document-Your-Contribution.md).
* Your pull request:
    * Passes all checks and has no conflicts.
    * Has a well-written title and message that briefly explains your proposed changes.

Lastly, sign all your commits with a line like this:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

This shows that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). It certifies that you wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) your contribution to the project.


## How to Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features?

We welcome all kinds of bug reports, user feedback and feature requests!

We've created some issue templates to assist you in this. Please use them to create [a new issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) in the relevant project's repository.


## How to Review & Contribute Science Design?

Most of our code is informed by an underlying Science Design. We develop these designs collaboratively and your contributions are most welcome!

Every science-based project contains Science Designs under a directory named **Science**. There you can find:
* PDFs that contain completed Science Designs.
* Markdown (or `.md`) files that contain link to a Science Design document that is still under development.

For instructions on how to contribute Science Designs, please read [this](Contributing/How-to-Contribute-Review-Science-Design.md) document.


## How to Suggest UI/UX Improvements?

One of the most important areas of improvement to our flagship software FLINT is the user interface. We really need your help with this!

If you have ideas on how we can improve, please share them with us by creating a [new issue]. We could then [start a new project](Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) for your idea!


## How to Contribute Translations?

Right now our interfaces do not support translations and we also don't have a translation strategy in place. But we want to change this. We want our projects to be accessible to non-English speakers. If you have any ideas then please share them with us by creating a [new issue].


## Are There Other Ways of Contributing?

Yes, there are a lot of other ways in which you can help us!

You can [coach new contributors](Contributing/How-to-Coach-New-Contributors.md), [answer user questions](Contributing/How-to-Answer-User-Questions.md), [organize events](Contributing/How-to-Organise-Events.md), help us in [administration](Contributing/How-to-Assist-with-Admin.md), [fundraising](Contributing/How-to-Assist-with-Fundraising.md), [website development](Contributing/How-to-Improve-the-Website.md), [communication/outreach](Contributing/How-to-Assist-with-Comms.md).
