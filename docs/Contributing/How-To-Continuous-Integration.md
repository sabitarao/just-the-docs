## Continuous Integration Tools

While not yet implemented, moja global intends to utilise Continuous Integration Tools.

It is not yet known the level of activity and rate of development that is likely to occur within moja global repositories.
Therefore it is difficult to specify how often integration should occur, this will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis for each repository.

Two Integration Tools have been identified for CI in moja global.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) supports Continuous Integration and testing for Linux.
[AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) supports Continous Integration and testing for Windows. Both services offer free packages for open-source projects.
