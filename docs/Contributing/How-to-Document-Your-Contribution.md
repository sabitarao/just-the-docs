## Document Code:   

There are five levels of documentation: 
  
1. Documentation in the code base  
    * Before commenting in the code try to clarify the code [with better naming and structuring](https://medium.com/@andrewgoldis/how-to-document-source-code-responsibly-2b2f303aa525). 
    * Use comments mainly to provide context to the reader of the code
    * Ensure comments are easy to maintain

1. Documentation in md-files
    * Use md-files for documentation that needs to be reviewed by maintainers before it is changed, including
        * How-To information
        * Plans 
        * Procedures
        * Governance documents
    * Submit changes using a pull-request

1. Documentation in the repository wiki
    * Use the repository wiki for information that can be changed by all collaborators without review, including
        * Tutorials
        * Explanations
        * Reference Information
    * Make changes and commit directly to the wiki
 
1. Documentation in Google Docs-files
    * Use the Google Docs for the collaborative development of documents (text equivalent of features branches), including
        * Science Designs
        * Architecture 
        * Strategy
    * Make changes in line with the [guidelines provided in the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1feo9G91bbjth9RZ4606Rag4tAdRxuYpfnlWecs-gbbY/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Documentation in PDF-files
    * Use the PDF-files for documentation that should no be changed (text equivalent of a release), including
        * Science Designs
        * Architecture
        * Strategy
        * Meeting notes
    * Errors can be pointed out to the document maintainer, all other changes can only be made in the next version which is still open in Google Docs
