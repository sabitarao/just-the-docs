# Set the configuration and run the system  

This includes the years to run, modules to use, carbon pools, which inputs to use (databases and spatial data) and policy settings to apply.  
This allows for reporting and the generation of multiple scenarios as required. 

Run the system. Currently this is command line driven: there are no user interfaces.
